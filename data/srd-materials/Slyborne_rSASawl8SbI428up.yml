    <p>Being part of a slyborne community means you come from a group that
    operates outside the law, including all manner of criminals, grifters, and
    con artists. <span class="og-omit">Members of slyborne communities are
    brought together by their disreputable goals and their clever means of
    achieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of
    unscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of
    any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast wealth
    and influence to those without a coin to their name. To the outside eye,
    slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty, but these communities
    possess some of the strictest codes of honor which, when broken, can result
    in a terrifying end for the transgressor.</span></p><p><em>Slyborne are
    often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd, and
    tenacious.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
    Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Scoundrel:</strong></em> You have advantage on
    rolls to negotiate with criminals, detect lies, or find a safe place to
    hide.</p>
