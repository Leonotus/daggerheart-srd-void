    Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Close range. On a success,
    they're Asleep until they take damage or the GM spends a Fear on their turn
    to clear this condition.</p><p><em><strong>Arcane Barrage:</strong></em>
    Once per rest, spend any number of Hope and shoot magical projectiles that
    strike a target of your choice within Close range. Roll a number of d6s
    equal to the Hope spent and deal that much magic damage to the
    target.</p><p><em><strong>Telepathy:</strong></em> Spend a Hope to open a
    line of mental communication with one target you can see. This connection
    lasts until your next rest or you cast Telepathy again.</p>
