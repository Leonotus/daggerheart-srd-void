    within Close range. On a success, they become temporarily
    <em>Enraptured</em>. While <em>Enraptured</em>, a target's attention is
    fixed on you, narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but
    your voice. Once per rest on a success, you can mark a Stress to force the
    <em>Enraptured</em> target to mark a Stress as well.</p>
