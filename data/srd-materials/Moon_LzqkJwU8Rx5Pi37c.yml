    <h6>Spellcast Trait</h6>
    <p>Instinct</p><h6>Foundation Features</h6><p><em><strong>Nightwatcher:</strong></em> When you are in moonlight, you have a +1 bonus to your Spellcast Rolls.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Ire of Pale Light:</strong></em> When a creature within Far range that you have cursed with your Hex fails an attack roll, they must mark a Stress.</p>
    <h6>Specialization Features</h6><p><em><strong>Moonglow:</strong></em> Mark a Stress to Glamour yourself and create a magical facade over your form.
     Your Glamour automatically drops the next time you take damage or at your next rest. While Glamoured you can:</p>
     <ul class="og-list-disc"><li>Take the form of any creature of your approximate size that youâ€™ve seen.</li><li>
     Enhance your own appearance. Gain advantage on Presence Rolls that leverage this change to its purpose.</li></ul>
    <h6>Mastery Features</h6><p><em><strong>Lunar Phases:</strong></em> During a long rest, instead of Communing, you can roll your Communion Dice to alter your form. 
    If any of the dice have matching values, reference the chart below for the effect.
     If you have multiple matches, choose one. If none match, choose a different downtime action. The effects last until your next rest.</p>
     <ul class="og-list-disc"><li>5-6: Eclipse - Gain a +1 bonus to your Evasion.</li><li>
     2-4: Waxing - Gain a +2 bonus to all damage rolls.</li><li>
     1-2: Waning - You can always spend a Hope to reduce Minor damage to None.</li></ul>
