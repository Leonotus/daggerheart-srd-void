    <p>Being part of a ridgeborne community means you've called the rocky peaks
    and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. <span class="og-omit">Those
    who've lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most
    because they've thrived among the most dangerous terrain many continents
    have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique
    technologies and equipment to move both people and products across difficult
    terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them
    sturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of
    formsâ€”some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others construct castles of
    stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces
    often struggle to attack ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large
    military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground
    advantage.</span></p><p><em>Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable,
    loyal, reserved, and stubborn.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
    Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Steady:</strong></em> You have advantage on rolls
    to traverse dangerous cliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and
    use your survival knowledge.</p>
