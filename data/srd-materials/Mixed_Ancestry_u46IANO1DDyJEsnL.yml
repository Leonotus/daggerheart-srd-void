    <p>Families are as unique as the peoples and cultures that inhabit them.
    Anyone's appearance and abilities can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity,
    or other variety of factors. If your character is a descendant of multiple
    ancestries, use the steps below:</p><h4 class="h6">Step 1. Choose an
    Ancestry Combination</h4><p>When you choose an heritage at character
    creation, write down how your character identifies. For example, if your
    character is descended from goblins and orcs, you could be a
    <strong>goblin-orc</strong>. You could also choose one ancestry you identify
    with—<strong>goblin</strong> or <strong>orc</strong>. Alternatively invent a
    new name for your ancestry—for example, <strong>toothling</strong>.</p><h4
    class="h6">Step 2. Choose Ancestry Features</h4><p>Choose the <strong>first
    feature</strong> from one ancestry, and the <strong>second feature</strong>
    from the other. For example, if you are mixing the goblin-orc ancestries,
    you can take the <em><strong>Surefooted</strong></em> and
    <em><strong>Tusks</strong></em> features, or the
    <em><strong>Sturdy</strong></em> and <em><strong>Danger Sense</strong></em>
    features.</p>
