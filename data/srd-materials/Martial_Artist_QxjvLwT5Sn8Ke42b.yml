    <h6>Foundation Features</h6><p><em><strong>Martial Form:</strong></em> Take the Martial Form sheet. You start with two martial stances from Tier 1.
     When you reach a new tier, take two additional stances at your tier or lower.</p>
     <em><strong>Focus</strong></em>: At character creation and at each rest, roll a number of d6 equal to your Instinct. Gain a number of Focus tokens equal to the highest value rolled and place them on this card.
      Spend a Focus each time you shift into a stance. It lasts until you you take Severe damage, the scene ends, you mark your last Hit Point, or you shift into another stance.</p>
     <h6>Specialization Features</h6><p><em><strong>Keen Defenses:</strong></em> When you are targeted by an attack, you can spend a Focus to make the adversaryâ€™s attack roll have disadvantage.</p>
    <em><strong>Spirit Blast:</strong></em> Spend a Focus to make an Attack Roll using Instinct against an adversary within Close range.
     On a success, you deal d20+3 magic damage using your Proficiency and can spend an additional Focus to make them temporarily Vulnerable.</p>
     <h6>Mastery Feature</h6><p><em><strong>Limit Breaker:</strong></em> Once per rest, you can pull off an unbelievable feat like running across water, leaping between distant rooftops,
      or scaling the side of a building without needing to roll. When you do, gain a Hope and clear a Stress.</p>
