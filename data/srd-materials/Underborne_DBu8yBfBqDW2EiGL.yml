    <p>Being part of an underborne community means you're from a subterranean
    society. Many underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other
    collectives, while some live much deeper. <span class="og-omit">These
    communities range from small family groups in burrows to massive
    metropolises in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized
    for their incredible boldness and skill that enable great feats of
    architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their
    bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered
    formidable belowground beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is
    common practice amongst these societies. Because of the dangers of their
    environment, many underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages
    that prove equally useful on the surface.</span></p><p><em>Underborne are
    often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and
    unpretentious.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
    Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Low-Light Living:</strong></em> When you're in an

    investigate, or perceive details within that area.</p>
