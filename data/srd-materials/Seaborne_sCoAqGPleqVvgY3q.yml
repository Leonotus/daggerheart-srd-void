    <p>Being part of a seaborne community means you lived on or near a large
    body of water. <span class="og-omit">Seaborne communities are built, both
    physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home. Some
    of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and
    travelers alike. These harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist
    attractions, or even just a safe place to lay down one's head after weeks of
    travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large ships, with
    the idea of "home" comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one
    landmass. No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely
    tied to the ocean tides and the creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn
    to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and swim
    in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are highly
    sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels,
    whether within their own community, working for another, or even at the helm
    of a powerful naval operation.</span></p><p><em>Seaborne are often candid,
    cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered.</em></p><h4
