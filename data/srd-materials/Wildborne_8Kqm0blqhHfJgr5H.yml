    <p>Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the
    forest. <span class="og-omit">Wildborne communities are defined by their
    dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong
    religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among. This results in
    unique architectural and technological advancements that favor
    sustainability over short-term, high-yield results. It is a hallmark of
    wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural
    environment and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While
    some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others
    establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest canopy. It's not
    uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland
    homes.</span></p><p><em>Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing,
    reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
