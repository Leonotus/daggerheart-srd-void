    <p>Being part of a highborne community means you're accustomed to a life of
    elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons of society. <span
    class="og-omit">Traditionally, members of a highborne community possess
    incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending
    on the community—including gold and other minerals, land, or controlling the
    means of production—this status always comes with power and influence.
    Highborne place great value on titles and possessions, and there is little
    social mobility within their ranks. Members of a highborne community often
    control the political and economic status of the areas in which they live
    due to their ability to influence people and the economy with their
    substantial wealth. The health and safety of the less affluent people who
    live in these locations often hinges on the ability of this highborne ruling
    class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects over
    profit.</span></p><p><em>Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving,
    enterprising, ostentatious, and unflappable.</em></p><h4
    class="h6">Community Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Privilege:</strong></em> You
    have advantage on rolls to consort with nobles, negotiate prices, or
    leverage your reputation to get what you want.</p>
