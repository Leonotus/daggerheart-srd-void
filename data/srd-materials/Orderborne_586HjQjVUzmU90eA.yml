    <p>Being part of an orderborne community means you're from a collective that
    focuses on discipline or faith, and you uphold a set of principles that
    reflect your experience there. <span class="og-omit">Orderborne are
    frequently some of the most powerful among the surrounding communities. By
    aligning the members of their society around a common value or goal, such as
    a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling
    bodies of these enclaves can mobilize larger populations with less effort.
    While orderborne communities take a variety of forms—some even profoundly
    pacifistic—perhaps the most feared are those that structure themselves
    around military prowess. In such a case, it's not uncommon for orderborne to
    provide soldiers for hire to other cities or
    countries.</span></p><p><em>Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent,
    pensive, prudent, sardonic, and stoic.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
    Feature</h4><p><em><strong>Dedicated:</strong></em> Record three sayings or
    values your upbringing instilled in you. Once per rest, when you describe
    how you're embodying one of these principles through your current action,
    you can roll a <strong>d20</strong> as your Hope Die.</p>
