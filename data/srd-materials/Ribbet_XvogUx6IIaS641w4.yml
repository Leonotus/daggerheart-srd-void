  description: >-
    <p>Ribbets resemble anthropomorphic frogs with protruding eyes and webbed
    hands and feet. <span class="og-omit">They have smooth (though sometimes
    warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on either side of their head. Some
    ribbets have hind legs more than twice the length of their torso, while
    others have short limbs. No matter their size (which ranges from about 3–4½
    feet (0.9–1.4 m)), ribbets primarily move by hopping. All ribbets have
    webbed appendages, allowing them to swim with ease. Some ribbets possess a
    natural green-and-brown camouflage, while others are vibrantly colored with
    bold patterns. No matter their appearance, all ribbets are born from eggs
    laid in the water, hatch into tadpoles, and after about 6 to 7 years, grow
    into amphibians that can move around on land. Ribbets live for approximately
    100 years.</span></p><h4 class="h6">Ancestry
