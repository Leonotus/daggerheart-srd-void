    forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide variety of cultures. <span
    class="og-omit">Unlike many communities that are defined by their locale,
    wanderborne are defined by their traveling lifestyle. Because of their
    frequent migration, wanderborne put less value on the accumulation of
    material possessions in favor of acquiring information, skills, and
    connections. While some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a
    religion or a set of political or economic values, others come together
    after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home or land. No matter the
    reason, the dangers posed by life on the road and the choice to continue
    down that road together mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering
    loyalty.</span></p><p><em>Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous,
    mirthful, reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.</em></p><h4 class="h6">Community
